# iOS-Core-Data-using-Swift
This example shows you how can you create Core Data from scratch - that is when you dont check that " Use Core Data " checkbox. The project uses table view to display the data, you can click on the cell which will take you to another view controller where you can edit the data. You can also swipe on a cell to delete the data.
